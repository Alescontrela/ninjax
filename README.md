========

Ninjax brings the flexibility of PyTorch and TensorFlow 2 to [JAX][jax]. Ninjax
is a simple state manager for JAX that makes it easy to have nested components
that update their own state. It's indended to be used together with a neural
network library, such as [Flax][flax] or [Haiku][flax].
